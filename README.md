# Canopy

Canopy is a parser compiler targeting Java, JavaScript, Python and Ruby. It
takes a file describing a [parsing expression grammar][1] and compiles it into a
parser module in the target language. The generated parsers have no runtime
dependency on Canopy itself.

For usage documentation see [canopy.jcoglan.com][2].

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for instructions for building the project.
